# MasterPythonscript
Python script to marge big files into one big file
* The goal of building a python script in this work is to better analyze the results from RSEM, BLAST and, PFAM. 
* Previously we used Excel to unify the files, yet Excel is known to be problematic for combining many files into one, especially with very large data files such as ours is (~ 670,000 rows). Building the python script saved us time and reduced the chance of error in copying the data.
* Python script to build “smart” average function: RNA is unstable; to remove the distortion of outlier results, a more sophisticated averaging method needed to be used.
